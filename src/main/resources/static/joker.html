			<h1>The Joker</h1>
			<blockquote>
			When the joker first appeared, he was portrayed as a psychopath with a twisted, sadistic sense of humor and a masterful criminal. The joker became a hilarious mischievous villain in the late 1950s under the rules of the board of comics review, before returning to his dark origins in the early 1970s. British writer Alan Moore mentioned the joker's identity and origin in his one-episode comic batman: a deadly joke, describing the joker as a comedian turned criminal with a "red hood". He is transformed by the death of his beloved wife and unborn child in an accident, and by the accidental staining of an abandoned pool of chemicals while being pursued by batman. The joker is a perfect match for batman because of his opposite personality and appearance.<br><br>
Joker does not have superpowers, but he has a far superior intelligence and elusive thinking. Clowns are adept at using their expertise in chemical engineering to develop toxic or deadly compounds and commit crimes using various props. He sometimes teams up with other Gotham supervillains, such as penguin and two-face, and occasionally works with groups like league of the unscrupulous and league of destruction, but these relationships generally end in breakdown because joker wants unbridled chaos. Harleen quetzel, the clown's psychiatrist in the 1990s, became attached to him and, after helping the clown escape from prison, changed her name to hallie quinn and became his assistant. Although the joker's main opponent is batman, the joker has fought other heroes, including superman and wonder woman.
