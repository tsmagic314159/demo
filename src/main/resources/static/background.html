			<h1>THE BACKGROUD OF JUSTICE LEAGUE</h1>
			<blockquote>
				Justice League (also known as Justice League of America/JLA) is a team of superheroes created by DC Comics and the name of the comic, animated, and audio products associated with it.
Justice league is the first real superhero team in the history of comic books. It was founded in the silver age and has a deep relationship with the heroic group justice society of America, which was founded in the golden age. The alliance is described as a "World's Greatest Super Heroes" team, made up of DC comics superheroes,
Such as superman, batman, wonder woman, flash and green lantern. The alliance was built because the heroes knew that if they fought alone, no matter how powerful, there would be crises they could not handle
So the superheroes came together as a first line of defense against threats to the planet, defending truth, justice, and freedom. Many DC heroes have joined the league and fought side by side.<br><br>
Note: although the justice league was once called the international justice league and the American justice league at one time, the justice league and the international justice league are not the same team.<br><br>
